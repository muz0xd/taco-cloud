There are three projects in this folder:

 - tacocloud : This is the same Taco Cloud project as in the previous chapter,
   altered to act as an OAuth2 resource server.
 - auth-server : An OAuth2 authorization server based on Spring Authorization
   Server (https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-authorization-server).
 - tacocloud-admin : An admin client to consume the API exposed by tacocloud,
   using tokens obtained from the auth-server.
